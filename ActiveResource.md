# Introduction #
This is a stub article for the [Active Resource](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveResource/Base.html) class included with Ruby on Rails.

_From the [Active Resource API Readme](http://api.rubyonrails.org/files/vendor/rails/activeresource/README.html):_

```
Active Resource (ARes) connects business objects and Representational 
State Transfer (REST) web services. It implements object-relational 
mapping for REST webservices to provide transparent proxying 
capabilities between a client (ActiveResource) and a RESTful service 
(which is provided by Simply RESTful routing in 
ActionController::Resources).

Active Resource attempts to provide a coherent wrapper object-relational
mapping for REST web services. It follows the same philosophy as
Active Record, in that one of its prime aims is to reduce the amount 
of code needed to map to these resources. This is made possible by 
relying on a number of code- and protocol-based conventions that make 
it easy for Active Resource to infer complex relations and structures.
These conventions are outlined in detail in the documentation for 
ActiveResource::Base.
