# Introduction #

This is a stub article for [Bowler](http://bowlerframework.org/), a RESTful Scala Web Framework.

_From the [Bowler website](http://bowlerframework.org/):_

> Bowler is a RESTful, multi-channel ready web framework in Scala with a functional flavour.

> RESTful URL routing based on Scalatra, supporting named parameters, wild card URL's or regex URL's (see more at the Scalatra URL)

> JSON API "for free": JSON is central in todays web landscape, be it to create rich webapps with Javascript frameworks like JQuery, or providing API's for mobile apps. Every GET URL in Bowler will return a JSON representation of the underlying view model if you set the HTTP "Accept" header to "application/json"

> HTTP Request to object mapping with ease: Bowler comes with out-of-the-box support to easily map from requests to arbitrary objects and back while respecting RESTful principles.
