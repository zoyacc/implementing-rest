# Introduction #

This is a stub article for [Crochet](https://github.com/xllora/Crochet), a lightweight RESTful web framework for Scala

_From the [Crochet readme file](https://github.com/xllora/Crochet#readme):_

> Crochet is a light weight web framework oriented to rapid prototyping of REST API. If you are looking for a Rails like framework written in Scala, please take a look at Lift at http://liftweb.net/.

> Crochet targets to help quickly prototype REST APIs relying on the flexibility of the Scala language. The initial ideas for Crochet were inspired after reading Gabriele Renzi post on creating a picoframework with Scala (see http://www.riffraff.info/2009/4/11/step-a-scala-web-picoframework) and the need for quickly prototyping APIs for pilot projects. Crochet also provides mechanisms to hide repetitive tasks involved with default responses and authentication/authorization piggybacking on the mechanics provided by application servers.

> The project uses SBT (http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/) to handle dependencies and the build process.
