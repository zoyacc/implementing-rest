This is a stub article for the [OpenRasta](http://trac.caffeine-it.com/openrasta) project


_From the [OpenRasta Documentation Page](http://trac.caffeine-it.com/openrasta/wiki/Doc):_

OpenRasta is a resource-oriented framework for .NET enabling easy ReST-ful development of web sites and services. OpenRasta is designed to run on .net 2.0 and above, and can co-exist peacefully with your existing ASP.NET and WCF deployments.

OpenRasta is also free, and ships with an MIT license. You are explicitly allowed to do whatever you want with the code, including shipping it as part of closed-source software. No cost involved, no hidden agenda, free for all.

Because OpenRasta is built on best practices, it is by far one of the most extensible frameworks, with more than a dozen extensibility points. Don't like something in OpenRasta? You can change every aspect of its behavior.}}}```
