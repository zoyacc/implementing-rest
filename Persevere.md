# Persevere #

_From an emil posting by Kris Zyp:_

Persevere http://www.persvr.org/ follows a REST-style architecture providing a uniform interface for resources, content negotiation, and mapping objects references to hyperlinks in data. The next version of Persevere http://github.com/kriszyp/pintura/ goes further, providing more OOTB media type handlers and conformance to the JSON schema internet draft (which defines link relations for RESTful JSON).
