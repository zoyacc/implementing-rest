This is a place for exploring aspects of implementing applications using the REST architectural style. This may include statements about existing frameworks and libraries, general discussions about the nature of the style and how it may be expressed and/or encouraged via a programming framework, etc.

This can take many forms including:
  * Pages that describe existing frameworks listing their features, strengths and drawbacks.
  * Links to resources on the subject of frameworks and REST-ful programming

This is meant to be a wide open space. If you would like to contribute here, contact one of the listed project owners.

## Existing REST Frameworks ##
We've started a list of available [REST Frameworks](RESTFrameworks.md) ([Language Matrix](ByLanguage.md)). If your favorite framework is not on this list, let me know.
