# RESTful System #

> A RESTful system progresses from one steady-state to the next, and each such steady-state is both a potential start-state and a potential end-state. I.e., a RESTful system is an unknown number of components obeying a simple set of rules such that they are always either at REST or transitioning from one RESTful state to another RESTful state.

> Each state can be completely understood by the representation(s) it contains and the set of transitions that it provides, with the transitions limited to a uniform set of actions to be understandable. The system may be a complex state diagram, but each user agent is only able to see one state at a time (the current steady-state) and thus each state is simple and can be analyzed independently. A user, OTOH, is able to create their own transitions at any time (e.g., enter a URL, select a bookmark, open an editor, etc.).
