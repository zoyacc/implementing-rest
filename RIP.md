# RIP - REST in Python #
RIP is a WSGI-based Web programming framework for busy Web developers who have to build and maintain numerous applications and services. RIP is for those who don't want a lot of magic because they have been burned before (or have learned from the mistakes of others - even better); who want consistency without lock-in; who want to save time, but only when they are not going to have to pay it back with interest; who want a framework to get out of the way instead of having to work around it. RIP is not about gimmics or gagets or buzzwords, rather it attempts to be a decently elegant way to create real software.
