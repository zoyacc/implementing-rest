# Recess is a REST oriented, full-stack PHP framework. #
http://www.recessframework.org

Recess makes it easy to quickly create RESTful web services.

Recess supports [8 HTTP Request Methods](http://github.com/recess/recess/blob/master/recess/recess/http/Methods.class.php)

Recess adds support for [41 Response Codes](http://github.com/recess/recess/blob/master/recess/recess/http/ResponseCodes.class.php)

Recess has explicit [Request](http://github.com/recess/recess/blob/master/recess/recess/http/Request.class.php) and [Response](http://github.com/recess/recess/blob/master/recess/recess/http/Response.class.php) classes

Recess extends PHP with [Annotations](http://www.recessframework.org/book/html/ch06s06.html) (such as [!Route](http://www.recessframework.org/book/html/ch08.html)).

Recess does content negotiation based on URL extension and [mime-type](http://github.com/recess/recess/blob/master/recess/recess/http/MimeTypes.class.php).

## Examples ##
Here is an [example app](http://uforcerec.hackyhack.net/) generated by Recess on top of an existing MySQL database using the default scaffolding spiced up with some json+schema content types ...

```
#GET /address/1/edit

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html

<form method="POST" action="/address/1">
 <input type="hidden" name="_METHOD" value="PUT" />
 <!-- ... -->
</form>
```

... it comes with content negotation
  * http://uforcerec.hackyhack.net/address.html
  * http://uforcerec.hackyhack.net/address.json
  * http://uforcerec.hackyhack.net/address.json+schema

... and a wicked [tool set](http://uforcerec.hackyhack.net/recess/routes/)
