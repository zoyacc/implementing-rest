# Introduction #

This is a stub article for [Unfiltered](https://github.com/n8han/Unfiltered), a toolkit for servicing HTTP requests in Scala.

_From the [Unfiltered README](https://github.com/n8han/Unfiltered/blob/master/README.markdown):_

> Unfiltered embraces the HTTP protocol, Scala, type-safety, and minimalism. It enables applications to handle HTTP requests as partial functions that take requests and return functions to respond to them. Typically, applications pattern-match requests against nested extractor objects. HTTP responses are defined with response combinator functions.
