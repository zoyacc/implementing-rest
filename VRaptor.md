> VRaptor3 focuses on simplicity and, therefore, all of its functionalities have as main goal solve the developer's problem in the less intrusive way.

> Either CRUD operations or more complex functionalities such as download, upload, results in different formats (xml, json, xhtml etc), everything is done through VRaptor3's simple and easy-to-understand functionalities. You don't have to deal directly with Http[.md](.md)Servlet[.md](.md)Request, Responses or any javax.servlet API, although you still have the control of all Web operations.
