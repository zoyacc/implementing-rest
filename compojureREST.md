_From the [project README](http://github.com/ordnungswidrig/compojure-rest)_

Compojure-rest is a thin layer for building RESTful applications on top of compojure. It is loosely modeled after webmachine. It provides a bunch of decorates which can be combined to provide a sophisticated implementation of the HTTP RFC.

Compojure-rest is still in active development and must be considered an incomplete ALPHA release

## Example 1 ##
A small example web application as in test.clj
```
(ns test
  (:use compojure)
  (:use compojure-rest))

(defn hello-resource [request]
  ((-> (method-not-allowed)
       (wrap-generate-body (fn [r] (str "Hello " ((request :params) :who "stranger"))))
       (wrap-etag (comp :who :params))
       (wrap-expiry (constantly 10000)) 
       (wrap-last-modified -1000)
       (wrap-exists (comp not #(some #{%} ["cat"]) :who :params))
       (wrap-auth (comp not #(some #{%} ["evil"]) :who :params))
       (wrap-allow (comp not #(some #{%} ["scott"]) :who :params)))
   request))

(defroutes my-app
  (ANY "/hello/:who" hello-resource)
  (GET "/simple" (str "simple"))
  (GET "/echo/:foo" (fn [req] {:headers { "Content-Type" "text/plain" } :body (str (dissoc req :servlet-request))}))
  (GET "*" (page-not-found)))

(defn main []
  (do
    (defserver test-server {:port 8080} "/*" (servlet my-app))
    (start test-server)))
```

## Example 2 ##

You can also define a resource in a more RESTful way, like webmachine allows:

```
(def product-resource
 (resource
  :content-types-provided [ "text/html", "text/plain"]
  :exists (fn [req] (if-let [id (-> req :route-params :id)]
          (if (< id 10)
            (assoc req ::product (str "P-" id)))))
  :generate-etag (fn [req] (str "X-" (req ::product)))
  :delete (fn [req] "deleted")
  :put    (fn [req] (str "PUT: "
             ((req :route-params) :id) (req :body)))
  :get    {
       "text/html" (fn [req] (str "<h1>" (req ::product) "</h1>"))
       :json (fn [req] (str "JSON: " (req ::product)))
       :xml  (fn [req] (str "XML:"   (req ::product)))}))
```
